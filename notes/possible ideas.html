								<li><b>Background: </b> Our world is currently experiencing population aging. While the pace of aging may vary - developed countries in Europe and America being in the middle stage and developing countries such as China being in the early stages - all countries face similar challenges: decreases in the working-age population and an increase in social burden can cause the economic output growth to slow down, which, in turn, may further lead to potential conflicts in the distribution field, bringing economic recessions and social instability. The ageing society is a significant issue that must be addressed in all countries.
								<br>Current research has focused on increasing the consumption of the elderly and reducing the burden of elderly care. These studies recommend developing a "silver market" to target the consumption needs of the elderly and providing more elderly care as public services to reduce the pressure on young people to support their elders. These approaches are necessary but insufficiently, as they are mainly derived from the point of view that treats the elderly as unproductive piggy banks or social burdens. Yet to build a harmonious and sustainable aging society, it is necessary to change this mindset. <b>Elderly people are also able to contribute to socio-economic development with proper measures taken.</b> (See <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Ageing_Europe_-_statistics_on_working_and_moving_into_retirement&oldid=581874#:~:text=Across%20the%20EU%20Member%20States,by%20Latvia%20(9.2%20%25).">the Employment of Older Workers in Europe</a> and <a href="https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/topic/ageing-workforce">related research and data in Europe</a>)

								<li><b>Motivation: </b>One way to achieve this is to provide trainings to relatively old workers, allowing them to accumulate new human capital and reducing the depreciation rate of their existing human capital. This will make them more adaptable to today's rapidly changing work environment and improve their productivity. From an individual perspective, this will enable them to live with greater dignity in the society; from a macro perspective, elderly workers can continue to contribute to the economy, fundamentally altering the phenomenon that "ageing society" has become a synonym for increasing social burden and slowing economic growth. Another approach is to identify and leverage the strengths of elderly workers' existing human capital, through which we can improve the efficiency in utilizing their skills and increasing their labor market returns. </li>
								<li><b>Question: </b>How does a supporting policy for elderly worker affects their labor market outcomes (wage, competitiveness, etc) and economic efficiency (the marginal economic benefits from investing in old-age worker training VS in younger worker training, conditional on current level of investment)?</li>
								<li><b>Existing Literature: </b>Horie et al. (2023) reveal that in China and Eastern Europe, the wage function has been flattening with respect to experience (or age) in recent decades, suggesting that the growth of experience and age fails to result in higher returns for individuals. Some research interprets this trend as evidence of increasing discrimination against elderly workers in the workplace. (xxx,) Other studies suggest that this is due to a growing number of older workers struggling to adapt to a rapidly changing work environment, hence unable to properly perform their current job responsibilities; they are effectively hidden unemployed and thus . However, Park and Shin (2023) show that older people are probably more willing and able to learn new technologies than we think they are</li>

								<p>One strand of the current literature on improving the human capital of older workers focus on <u>improving health conditions</u> (e.g., Poscia et al, 2016; Magnavita et al, 2017; Magnavita et al, 2018), rather than helping them obtain skills.</p>
								<p>Another strand of literature focuses more on increasing labor force participation of the elderly. These studies usually approach the issue through retirement policies, e.g., postponing the legal age of retirement (), altering pension schemes to incentivise labor market participation, etc. This is necessary but insufficient, since increasing productivity of the elderly is not just a matter of willingness, but also of ability, for which human capital accumulation is key.</p>

								<li><b>Motivation and clarification/definition: </b>
									In the literature of financial investment, returns and risks are explored; in the past decades, research on risks has been attracting even more attention from academia. Yet, in the field of human captial investment, the estimation of returns to eduation, training and health has always been in the center of the stage, leaving risks relatively little explored.
									<br>
									Parallel to the ideas of return and risk in financial investment which take the forms of financial market performance, returns and risks to human capital, especially to education, can be defined as labor market outcomes and their uncertainty. Take salary as an example. The returns one receives from higher education compared to high school can be defined as the marginal increase of expected wages one earns if they go to college instead of leaving school after high school, holding other factors constant. <u>One possible definition</u> of the risk of this outcome would be the probability of this marginal increase to be negative, or, more broadly, the . (Risks of investing in a stock, for example, can be defined as the probability of receiving a negative return, compared to taking no action in the financial market, i.e., the risk-free rate.)

								<li><b>Motivation and clarification/definition: </b></li>Such corresponding definitions can be used in various labor market outcomes, such as employment status - the marginal increase in job stability (measured for example as the average time staying in the same job) for receiving more education, and the probability of this increase to be negative. Considering the perpetuity of the returns to human capital investment, we can also define risks of such returns as the fluctuation of salary over the life cycle, as in Delaney and Devereux(2021).

								<li><b>Background and Definition: </b>
									Academic drifts, or academization, refers to the trend that second tier and more practical-oriented universities try to improve their status by imitating top-tier and academic-oriented universities. They normally shift their emphases from cultivating technical capabilities required for economic production to emphasizing research production, from being a specialized institute to comprehensive university. They also invest more in research institutes, hiring more faculty staff members with better academic background, counting more of a, increasing the proportion of full-time students.
									<br>Academic drifts happen in some universities around the end of the first decade of the 21st century in China, and universities successfully academized can attract more funding from the public education system. 
									<br>Academic drifts may cause worse student satisfation and poorer labor market performance for graduates, since they are picking up fewer practical skills for work in the universities. But it is also possible that graduates from these universities perform better in the labor market since the status of their universities have improved.

								<li><b>Question: </b>Is there a general trend of academic drifts in the Chinese university system, especially from 2010 to 2020? If so, what are the economic consequences of it?</li>
