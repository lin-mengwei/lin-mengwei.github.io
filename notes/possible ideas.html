								<li><b>Background: </b> Our world is currently experiencing population aging. While the pace of aging may vary - developed countries in Europe and America being in the middle stage and developing countries such as China being in the early stages - all countries face similar challenges: decreases in the working-age population and an increase in social burden can cause the economic output growth to slow down, which, in turn, may further lead to potential conflicts in the distribution field, bringing economic recessions and social instability. The ageing society is a significant issue that must be addressed in all countries.
								<br>Current research has focused on increasing the consumption of the elderly and reducing the burden of social elderly care. These studies recommend developing a "silver market" to target the consumption needs of the elderly and providing more elderly care as public services to reduce the pressure on young people to support their elders. These approaches are necessary but insufficiently, as they are mainly derived from the point of view that treat the elderly as unproductive piggy banks or social burdens.	To build a harmonious and sustainable aging society, it is necessary to change our mindset. <b>Elderly people are also able to contribute to socio-economic development with proper measures taken.</b> (See <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Ageing_Europe_-_statistics_on_working_and_moving_into_retirement&oldid=581874#:~:text=Across%20the%20EU%20Member%20States,by%20Latvia%20(9.2%20%25).">the Employment of Older Workers in Europe</a> and <a href="https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/topic/ageing-workforce">related research and data in Europe</a>)

								<li><b>Motivation: </b>One way to achieve this is to provide trainings to relatively old workers, allowing them to accumulate new human capital and reducing the depreciation rate of their human capital. This will make them more adaptable to today's rapidly changing work environment and improve their productivity. From an individual perspective, this will enable them to live with greater dignity in the society; from a macro perspective, elderly workers can continue to contribute to the economy, fundamentally altering the phenomenon that aging society" has become a synonym for increasing social burden and slowing economic growth. Another approach is to identify and leverage the strengths of elderly workers' existing human capital, through which we can improve the efficiency in utilizing their skills and increasing their labor market returns. </li>
								<li><b>Existing Literature: </b>Horie et al. (2023) reveal that in China and Eastern Europe, the wage function has been flattening with respect to experience (or age) in recent decades, suggesting that the growth of experience and age fails to result in higher returns for individuals. Some research interprets this trend as evidence of increasing discrimination against elderly workers in the workplace. (xxx,) Other studies suggest that this is due to a growing number of older workers struggling to adapt to a rapidly changing work environment, hence unable to properly perform their current job responsibilities; they are effectively hidden unemployed and thus .</li>
								<li><b>Question: </b>How does a supporting policy for elderly worker affects their labor market outcomes and economic efficiency?</li>
