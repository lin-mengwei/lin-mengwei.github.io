								<li><b>Question: </b>How does students finance an unexpected increase in tuition fees at a Swiss university and how do the effects on student finances translate into effects on on-time degree completion and grades?</li>
								<li><b>Broader Question: </b> tuition fees → academic performance</li>
								<li><b>Policy Change: </b> In the spring of 2012, the University of St. Gallen unexpectedly raised tuition fees for all students (CHF950 or 80% for foreigners and CHF200 or 20% for Swiss students per semester), including those who were already enrolled. </li>

								<li><b>Policy Change: </b>A progressive reform in England during two decades from 1998 - The shift moved England's higher education system from a free system to a high fee, high aid system, and shifted the costs of higher education away from the taxpayer and towards graduates themselves, with universities and students the key financial beneficiaries.</li>
