						<h6>Daniel Rees. <u>Safeguarding Consumers through Minimum Quality Standards: Milk Inspections and Urban Mortality, 1880-1910</u> </h6>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Question: </b></li>
							<li><b>Broader Question: </b></li>
							<li><b>Policy change: </b>milk inspections - the hiring of milk inspectors to enforce a minimum threshold (12%) for milk solids</li>
							<li><b>Outcomes: </b>infant motality, mortality from food-borne and waterborne diseases /li>
							<li><b>Data Source: </b>mortality in 35 cities from 1880-1910 (digitalized from annual municipal and stata public health records) </li>
							<li><b>Identification: </b>	</li>
							<li><b>Conclusion:</b>In five years, milk inspections are associated with 12 percent reduction in mortality from waterborn diseases, and in 10+ years, 19 percent.</li>
							<li><b>Important Details: </b>
								<ol>
									<li>Look at mortality from warterborne diseases rather than total mortality which (statistically) has zero change.</li>

							<h6>Maria Lombardi. <em>The effect of high dismissal protection on bureaucratic turnover and productivity</em>. </h6>

						<div class="line-title-body">

						<div class="slide-body">
							<ul class="nodots">
								<li><b>Question: </b>What is the impact of high dismissal protection for civic servants on turnover and productivity (in the context of public school teachers in Chile)?</li>
								<li><b>Definitions:</b>
									<ol class="dots">
										<li>high dismissal protection: a law in 2015 granting a permanent contract to temporary teachers with a minimum seniority by 2015 (<b>policy change</b>)</li>
										<li>productivity: standardized test scores of students</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li><b>Background: </b>teachers get hired by municipalities as permanent or temporary workers, having the same salary/benefits/job but different dismissal protection. Permanent ones do better in the standardized teacher evaluation.</li>
								<li><b>Data: </b><u>admin data</u> </li>
								<li><b>Identification: Diff-in-diff (teachers affected vs not affected before and after)</b>
								</li>
								<li><b>Results: </b> High dismissal protection can be a double-edged sword. It:
									<br> 1)  reduces turnover by 25 percent in the first two years. (<em>Heterogeneity</em>: The reduction is statistically significant among teachers both at the bottom and top of the distribution of baseline performance - average quality unchanged: keeping both best and worst ones) and
									<br> 2) decreases the learning of students taught by teachers with low baseline performance, but there is no effect on overall student test scores.
								</li>
								<li><b>Lit Review/Contribution: </b> Pay attention to how they sort it!
									<ol class="dots">
										<li>contributions to personnel economics of the state,and <u>a common but barely examined</u>policy</li>
