						<h6>Pedro Rey. <u>Ideological Bias prevents evidence-based policy implementation: emperimental evidence from local policy makers</u> </h6>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Conclusion:</b></li>

							<li><b>Question: </b>Why are evidence-based policies rarely implemented? How important is ideological bias in this?</li>
							<li><b>Broader Question: </b></li>
							<li><b>Policy change: </b>RCT: vary political affiliation of whom informes policy makers, communication channel--policy report vs media, experimental survey about belief updating; (tourism policy)</li>
							<li><b>Outcomes: </b></li>
							<li><b>Data Source: </b></li>
							<li><b>Identification: </b>RCT: selection of touristic municipalities in Spain (5,678), classifying them into left and right (ideology); 942 control cities--no info, 2,841 receiving policy brief (from think tank with same ideology, neutral one, and an opposed one), 1,895 receiving a media article (from media with same ideology,  and an opposed one). </li>

						<h6>Daniel Rees. <u>Safeguarding Consumers through Minimum Quality Standards: Milk Inspections and Urban Mortality, 1880-1910</u> </h6>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Question: </b></li>
							<li><b>Broader Question: </b></li>
							<li><b>Policy change: </b>milk inspections - the hiring of milk inspectors to enforce a minimum threshold (12%) for milk solids</li>
							<li><b>Outcomes: </b>infant motality, mortality from food-borne and waterborne diseases /li>
							<li><b>Data Source: </b>mortality in 35 cities from 1880-1910 (digitalized from annual municipal and stata public health records) </li>
							<li><b>Identification: </b>	</li>
							<li><b>Conclusion:</b>In five years, milk inspections are associated with 12 percent reduction in mortality from waterborn diseases, and in 10+ years, 19 percent.</li>
							<li><b>Important Details: </b>
								<ol>
									<li>Look at mortality from warterborne diseases rather than total mortality which (statistically) has zero change.</li>

						<div class="slide-body">
							<ul class="nodots">
								<li><b>Question: </b>What is the impact of high dismissal protection for civic servants on turnover and productivity (in the context of public school teachers in Chile)?</li>
								<li><b>Definitions:</b>
									<ol class="dots">
										<li>high dismissal protection: a law in 2015 granting a permanent contract to temporary teachers with a minimum "seniority" (3-4 years) by 2015 (<b>policy change</b>)</li>
										<li>productivity: standardized test scores of students</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li><b>Background: </b>teachers get hired by municipalities as permanent or temporary workers, having the same salary/benefits/job but different dismissal protection. Permanent ones do better in the standardized teacher evaluation.</li>
								<li><b>Data: </b><u>admin data</u> on all teaching positions in Chile, 2003-2016 (Chilean Ministry of Education)</li>
								<li><b>Identification: Diff-in-diff (teachers with 2 vs 3 years of experience in 2014)</b>
								</li>
								<li><b>Results: </b> High dismissal protection can be a double-edged sword. It:
									<br> 1)  reduces turnover by 25 percent in the first two years. (<em>Heterogeneity</em>: The reduction is statistically significant among teachers both at the bottom and top of the distribution of baseline performance - average quality unchanged: keeping both best and worst ones) and
									<br> 2) decreases the learning of students taught by teachers with low baseline performance, but there is no effect on overall student test scores.

							<ul class="nodots">
								<li><b>Question: </b>Asymmetry of opportunity/Procedural Fairness → redistribution OR crime? 
								<br>How does asymmetry in opporyunnity impact preferences for redisibution and both then affect policing as crime deterrent (amonst the wealthy) and the willingness to commit crime (amongst the poor)?
								</li>							
								<li><b>Background: </b>In a society where you know your income is based on effort while some other people's are based on luck.</li>
								<li><b>Method: Lab experiment</b> - one group earning their income through effort; one through luck with efforts (costs); one through pure luck. People are divided into <u>rich(80) and poor(20)</u> groups.
									<ol class="dots">
										<li>Earners work for 15 min first to earn their endowments depending either by work or luck</li>
										<li>(pure luck) Inheriters come in and get their endowments (some got 80, some 20)</li>
										<li>People decide the level of redistribution they prefer, then redistribution relized.</li>
										<li>Rich people choose investment in policing; poor people choose whether to steal or not.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li><b>Results: </b> 1. Distribution preferences: In general, with more luck as a determinant of income, people choose a higher rate of redistribution. Poor people choose higher redistribution.
								<br>2. Crime and Policing: Real policing investment is lower than optimal. Poor particiants guess that policing is higher than it really is.
								</li>
								<li><b>Contribution: </b> They go from a detailed lit summary to three contributions and then expand them!

										<li>distinguishing two types of fairness: reward for work vs for talent/performance</li>
										<li>distinguishing fairness of procedure vs of outcomes</li>
