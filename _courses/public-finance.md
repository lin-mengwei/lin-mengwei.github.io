*Regional and Local Public Economics* builds on previous courses (Public Sector Economics, Public Finance, Tax System), and focuses on the discussion of the <b>fiscal relationships between central and regional governments</b> and the <b>centralization versus decentralization</b> of fiscal practices. In this course, I try guide students to analyze the behavior of governments as economic agents through the lens of decentralized public finance, rather than focusing on the system of taxation and expenditures itself.

Here you can find the information for <b>parts two</b> (decentralization of govt expenditure & inter-govt grants) and <b>three</b> (internatioanl comparison & policy analysis) of it. The first part of the course (decentralization of taxation) is taught by [Andreu Arenas](https://sites.google.com/site/andreuarenasweb/home).

There are **16 two-hour lectures** in my part:

1. <b>Theory 2: Decentralization of Government Expenditure</b> (4 lectures) <br>
	1. Government levels and functions (0311)<br>
	2. Key elements and the optimalization problem of decentralization (0314)<br>
	3. Optimal size of jurisdiction for expenditure (0318)<br>
	4. Mobility, Congestion, and Clustering + In-class unit exercise (0321)
<br><br>

2. <b>Theory 3: Intergovernmental Grants (4 lectures)</b> <br>
	1. Intergovernmental grant and its functions (0404) <br>
	2. Analyzing intergovernmental grants: modelling (0415)<br>
	3. Effects of intergovernmental grants: theoretical implications (0418) <br>
	4. Effects of intergovernmental grants: empiric + In-class unit exercise (0422)
<br><br>

3. <b>Application 1: International Cases and Hot Issues (4 lectures)</b> <br>
	1. Fiscal Decentralization of Spain (+ Taxation and Mobility)<br>
	2. Fiscal Decentralization of Canada (+ Equalizing Grants)<br>

	4. Fiscal Decentralization of China (+ Land Finance)

5. <b>Application 2: Policy analysis and Empirical Methods (4 lectures) </b><br>
	1. Education and Fiscal Decentralization (Method: Diff-in-Diff 1)<br>
	2. Health and Welfare and Fiscal Decentralization (Method: Diff-in-Diff 2)<br>
