This course, *Regional and Local Public Finance*, builds on previous courses (Public Sector Economics, Public Finance, Tax System I), and focuses on the discussion of <b>centralization versus decentralization</b> of fiscal practices. Here you can find the information for <b>parts two</b> (decentralization of govt expenditure & inter-govt grants) and <b>three</b> (internatioanl comparison & policy analysis) of it. 

(The first part of the course is taught by [Andreu Arenas](https://sites.google.com/site/andreuarenasweb/home), discussing decentralization of taxation.)

There are **16 two-hour lectures** in my part:

1. Government Levels and Decentralization of Expenditure (4 lectures), 

2. Intergovernmental Grants (3 lecture), 

3. International Comparisons: fiscal decentralization in Canada, China, Germany and Spain (4 lectures),

4. Policy analysis: Education, Health, Transportation, Welfare and Local Development (5 lectures), and

5. Midterm exam (May 2nd).

I thank Zelda Brutti, [Candan Erdemli](https://candanerdemli.com/) and [Ha Luong](https://haluong.weebly.com/) for useful materials compiled by them in previous years during their teaching.
