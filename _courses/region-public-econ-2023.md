#### Introduction
*Regional and Local Public Economics* enables students to analyze the behavior of governments as economic agents and the outcomes of public policies through the lens of decentralized public finance.


#### Modules

I teach **16 two-hour lectures**, which I structured to be **4 units**:

<b>Theory 2: Decentralization of Government Expenditure (4 lectures) </b><br>
	1. Government levels and functions (0311)<br>
	2. Key elements and the optimalization problem of decentralization (0314)<br>
	3. Optimal jurisdiction size for expenditure responsibilities (0318)<br>
	4. Mobility, Congestion, and Clustering + In-class unit exercise (0321)
<br><br>

<b>Theory 3: Intergovernmental Grants (4 lectures)</b> <br>
	1. Intergovernmental grant and its functions (0404)<br>
	2. Analyzing intergovernmental grants: modelling (0415)<br>
	3. Effects of intergovernmental grants: theoretical implications (0418)<br>
	4. Effects of intergovernmental grants: empiric + In-class unit exercise (0422)
<br><br>

<b>Application 1: International Cases and Hot Issues (4 lectures)</b> <br>
In this unit, I apply the framework built in the Theory parts to characterize fiscal decentralization in each country, and discuss country-specific issues related to fiscal decentralization. <br>
	1. Fiscal Decentralization of Spain (+ Taxation and Mobility) (0425)<br>
	2. Fiscal Decentralization of Canada (+ Equalizing Grants) (0429)<br>
	3. Fiscal Decentralization of China (+ Land Finance & SNG Debts) (0506) <br>
	4. Fiscal Decentralization of Germany (+ SNG Debts & Debt Brake) (0509)
<br><br>

<b>Continuous Assessment: midterm exam + discussion (1 lecture)</b> (0502, 0513)
<br><br>

<b>Application 2: Decentralization Practice & Policy Evaluation (3 lectures) </b> <br>
	1. Education under Fiscal Decentralization (+ Intro to Causal Inference + Diff-in-Diff) (0513) <br> 
	2. Fiscal Decentralization and Healthcare (+ Diff-in-Diff Cont.) (0516) <br> 
	3. Decentralization and Transportation + Economic Growth (+ IV) (0523) <br>
