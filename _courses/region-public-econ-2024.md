#### Introduction
*Regional and Local Public Economics* enables students to analyze the behavior of governments as economic agents and the outcomes of public policies through the lens of decentralized public finance. You can also find the [materials from last year](https://lin-mengwei.github.io/region-public-econ-2023.html), when I re-designed and taught 16 lectures on topics from Expenditure Decentralization to Policy Evaluation.


#### Lectures

I teach **8 two-hour lectures** this year:

<b>Theory 3: Intergovernmental Grants (4 lectures)</b> <br>
	1. Intergovernmental grant and its functions <br>
	2. Analyzing intergovernmental grants: modelling <br>
	3. Effects of intergovernmental grants: theoretical implications <br>
	4. Effects of intergovernmental grants: empiric + In-class unit exercise 
<br><br>

<b>Application 1: International Cases and Hot Issues (2 out of 4 lectures)</b> <br>
In this unit, I apply the framework built in the Theory parts to characterize fiscal decentralization in each country, and discuss country-specific issues related to fiscal decentralization. <br>
	1. Fiscal Decentralization of China (+ Land Finance & SNG Debts)  <br>
	2. Fiscal Decentralization of Germany (+ SNG Debts & Debt Brake) 
<br><br>

<b>Application 2: Decentralization Practice & Policy Evaluation (2 out of 3 lectures) </b><br>
	1. Education under Fiscal Decentralization (Method: Diff-in-Diff) <br> 
	2. Fiscal Decentralization and Healthcare (Method: Diff-in-Diff) <br>
