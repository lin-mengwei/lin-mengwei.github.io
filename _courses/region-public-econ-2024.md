#### Introduction
*Regional and Local Public Economics* builds on previous courses (Public Sector Economics, Public Finance, Tax System), and focuses on the discussion of the <b>fiscal relationships between central and regional governments</b> and the <b>centralization versus decentralization</b> of fiscal practices. In this course, I try guide students to analyze the behavior of governments as economic agents and the outcomes of public policies through the lens of decentralized public finance, rather than focusing on the system of taxation and expenditures itself.

Here you can find the information for <b>parts II</b> (decentralization of govt expenditure & inter-govt grants) and <b>III</b> (internatioanl comparison & policy analysis) of it, co-taught with [Julia McGee](https://sites.google.com/view/julia-mcgee). Part I (decentralization of taxation) is taught by [Andreu Arenas](https://sites.google.com/site/andreuarenasweb/home).

You can also find the [materials from last year](https://lin-mengwei.github.io/region-public-econ-2023.html), when I designed and taught both parts II & III.


#### Modules

There are **8 two-hour lectures** in my part,  **4 units**:

<b>Theory 3: Intergovernmental Grants (4 lectures)</b> <br>
	1. Intergovernmental grant and its functions (0404) [slides](https://campusvirtual.ub.edu/pluginfile.php/8118122/mod_resource/content/1/0404_intergovernmental_grants_I.pdf)<br>
	2. Analyzing intergovernmental grants: modelling (0415) [slides](https://campusvirtual.ub.edu/pluginfile.php/8132330/mod_resource/content/3/0415_intergovernmental_grants_II.pdf)<br>
	3. Effects of intergovernmental grants: theoretical implications (0418) [slides](https://campusvirtual.ub.edu/pluginfile.php/8137200/mod_resource/content/1/0418_intergovernmental_grants_III.pdf)<br>
	4. Effects of intergovernmental grants: empiric + In-class unit exercise (0422) [slides](https://campusvirtual.ub.edu/pluginfile.php/8140050/mod_resource/content/1/0422_intergovernmental_grants_IV.pdf)
<br><br>

<b>Application 1: International Cases and Hot Issues (2 out of 4 lectures)</b> <br>
In this unit, I apply the framework built in the Theory parts to characterize fiscal decentralization in each country, and discuss country-specific issues related to fiscal decentralization. <br>
	1. Fiscal Decentralization of China (+ Land Finance & SNG Debts)  <br>
	2. Fiscal Decentralization of Germany (+ SNG Debts & Debt Brake) 
<br><br>

<b>Application 2: Decentralization Practice & Policy Evaluation (2 out of 3 lectures) </b><br>
	1. Education under Fiscal Decentralization (Method: Ideal Experiments & Diff-in-Diff) (0513)<br> 
	2. Fiscal Decentralization and Healthcare (Method: Diff-in-Diff) (0516)<br>
