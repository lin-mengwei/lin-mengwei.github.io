I initiate and organize academic activities with the goal of creating shared value and benefiting the community.

Below are some selected activities for which I take the main organizational responsibility. If you’re interested in organizing similar events, feel free to reach out—I’d be happy to share my experience!

This is a program funded under a [EDUB](https://web.ub.edu/en/web/escola-doctorat/) project for which I am the grant recipient, running during academic years 2024/25 and 2025/26. The design and organiztaion of the program  my PhD colleagues and the admin staff at the [UBSE](https://www.ub.edu/school-economics/). (See: [UBSE News on the Launch of BESTEPS](https://www.ub.edu/school-economics/kick-off-of-the-besteps-with-antonio-cabrales/))

BESTEPS offers PhD students comprehensive guidance and expertise on every key stage of developing a research project. By offering systematic guidance from experienced researchers, the program empowers participants to take the “best steps” toward conducting research efficiently.

BESTEPS consists of 7 Lectures taught by renowned scholars:
  - Opening Lecture: [Workflows of Economics Research](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7295739310534717440/) (Lecturer: Prof. Antonio Cabrales)

The PhD Ideas Coffees is a regular event series at the UB School of Economics, which I initiated with other colleagues in 2024. It has received invaluable support from the PhD in Economics Program. I have been in charge of the series in acadmic years 2023/24 and 2024/25.

We host biweekly meetings to talk about newly formed immature ideas and receive feedback from our peers in a friendly environment. The main objectives are to provide PhD students with informal feedback, share insights on common research challenges, understand fellow students' research and interests, and foster collaboration within the Economics PhD program.


<b>3. Applied Econometric Methods Reading Group </b> (In Preparation)

The reading group meets once a month, with one member sharing a new methodological advancement in applied economics. We aim to cover newly-developed methods in causal inference that are not yet commonly taught in the standard graduate-level cirriculum of applied econometrics. Topics include:
  - Shift-share Instruments
  - Staggered DID with Continuous Treatments
