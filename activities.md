I initiate and organize academic activities with the goal of creating shared value and benefiting the community.

Below are some selected activities I am proud of. If you’re interested in organizing similar events, feel free to reach out—I’d be happy to share my experience!

BESTEPS provides PhD students with comprehensive guidance for <b>key stages of a research project</b>. Through expert-led lectures, the program empowers participants to take the "best steps" toward conducting rigorous research efficiently.

This is a program supported by a [EDUB-funded project](https://web.ub.edu/en/web/escola-doctorat/){:target="_blank"} for which I am the grant recipient, running during academic years 2024/25 and 2025/26. The design and organiztaion of the program is a joint effort with my PhD colleagues and the [UBSE](https://www.ub.edu/school-economics/){:target="_blank"} staff. (See: [UBSE News on the Launch of BESTEPS](https://www.ub.edu/school-economics/kick-off-of-the-besteps-with-antonio-cabrales/){:target="_blank"})

BESTEPS consists of 7 Lectures taught by renowned scholars:
  - Opening Lecture: [Workflows of Economics Research](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7295739310534717440/){:target="_blank"} (Lecturer: Prof. Antonio Cabrales)
  - Lecture 1: [Starting a Feasible Project: Ideas, Literature, Exploratory Analysis](https://lin-mengwei.github.io/activities){:target="_blank"} (Lecturer: Prof. Libertad Gonzalez)
  - Lecture 2: [Doing Organized and Replicable Research](https://lin-mengwei.github.io/activities){:target="_blank"} (Lecturer: TBD)
  - Lecture 3: [Making Research Vivid: Visualization Practices](https://lin-mengwei.github.io/activities){:target="_blank"} (Lecturer: Prof. Dirk Foremny & Data Journalist TBD)
  - Lecture 4: [Communicating Research 1: Presentations, Posters and Elevator Pitches](https://lin-mengwei.github.io/activities){:target="_blank"} (Lecturer: TBD)
  - Lecture 5: [Communicating Research 2: Abstract, Introduction and Conclusion](https://lin-mengwei.github.io/activities){:target="_blank"} (Lecturer: TBD)

The Ideas Coffees are biweekly meetings to talk about <b>newly formed immature ideas</b> and receive feedback from our peers in a safe and friendly environment. The main objectives are to receive feedback before staring a project, understand fellow students' research and interests, and foster collaboration within the Economics PhD program. We also host occasional special sessions (e.g., sharing information of datasets).

This is an innovative event series for junior Economics researchers at [UBSE](https://www.ub.edu/school-economics/){:target="_blank"}, which I initiated with IEB PhD colleagues in 2024. It has received invaluable support from the PhD in Economics Program. I have been in charge of the series in acadmic years 2023/24 and 2024/25. (See: [Our event post, Dec. 2024](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/universitat-de-barcelona-school-of-economics_yesterday-we-concluded-the-final-session-activity-7275801743379046401-EGbN/){:target="_blank"})


<b>3. Applied Econometric Methods Reading Group </b> (In Preparation)

The reading group meets once a month, with one member sharing a new methodological advancement in applied economics. We aim to cover <b>newly-developed causal inference methods</b> that are not yet commonly taught in a standard graduate-level course of applied econometrics. Topics in 2025 include:
  - Shift-share Instruments
  - Staggered DID with Continuous Treatments
