  <p>Through expert-led lectures, BESTEPS offers PhD students necessary guidance to take "best steps" in different <b>key stages of a research project</b>.

  </summary>

  <p>The Ideas Coffees are biweekly sessions, designed for PhD students and Postdocs to talk about <b>newly formed immature ideas</b> in a safe and friendly environment. The main objectives are to receive feedback before starting a project, understand each others' research interests, and foster collaboration. We also host occasional special sessions (e.g., to share data info). </p> 

  <p>This is an innovative event series for junior Economists at <a href="https://www.ub.edu/school-economics/" target="_blank">UBSE</a>, which I initiated with IEB PhD colleagues in Spring 2024. It has received great support from the PhD in Economics Program. I am in charge of the series for AY 2023/24 and 2024/25. (See: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/universitat-de-barcelona-school-of-economics_economics-phd-research-activity-7316368944271962113-dzn8/" target="_blank">Our recent event post</a>)</p>

    <b>3. Job Market Preperation Process Improvement Plan</b> 
  </summary>
    <p> The plan <b>better prepares PhD candidates for the Job Market</b> through information sessions, personalized planning meetings, package tutoring, mock interviews, mock job market talks, etc. It was developed with invaluable input from JM candidates ahead of me, such as <a href="https://mariebeigelman.github.io/" target="_blank">Marie Beigelman</a>, <a href="https://abhinavkhemka.com" target="_blank">Abhinav Khemka</a>, Marianna Magagnoli, Alex Izquierdo, among others. The plan was approved by th Academic Committee, and has been implemented since the academic year 2024/25.</p>

  <p>The reading group meets monthly to share new methodological advancements in applied micro. We aim to cover <b>newly-developed causal inference methods</b> that are not yet commonly taught in a standard graduate-level econometrics course. It is planed and organized by Sergio Blanco, Cristina Aranzana,  Cecilia Ramirez, and myself, and supported by the Department of Public Economics and the IEB.</p>

  <p><b>Methods in 2025 (TBD) include:</b></p>
