Together with my colleagues at the UBSE and the UB Economics PhD Program, we design a <a href="https://www.ub.edu/school-economics/phd-students-training/" target="_blank">PhD Training Framework</a> — fully demand-driven efforts to create the training we always wanted to receive.

Below are some activities (within this framework) I am proud of as an initiator and organizer. They have been crucial support for both my peers and myself. Happy to share my organizational experience; feel free to reach out. **All for a better community!**
