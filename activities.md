Together with my colleagues at the UBSE and the PhD in Economics Program at the UB, we design a <a href="https://www.ub.edu/school-economics/phd-students-training/" target="_blank">PhD Training Framework</a>. These are fully demand-driven efforts to create the training I always wanted to receive.

Below are some selected activities (within this framework) I am proud of as an initiator and organizer. They have been crucial support of the research journeys of my peers and myself.

Happy to share my organizational experience; feel free to reach out.

All for a better community!!

  </summary>

  <p>The Ideas Coffees are biweekly sessions for PhD students and Postdocs to discuss <b>newly-formed research ideas</b> in a safe and friendly environment before starting a project. We also host occasional special sessions (e.g., to share data info). </p> 

  <p>This is an innovative series for junior Economists at <a href="https://www.ub.edu/school-economics/" target="_blank">UBSE</a>, which I initiated with my PhD colleagues. It has received great support from the PhD in Economics Program. I am in charge of the series for AY 2023/24 and 2024/25. (See: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/universitat-de-barcelona-school-of-economics_economics-phd-research-activity-7316368944271962113-dzn8/" target="_blank">Our recent event post</a>)</p>
