##### <b>Retake Costs and Academic Outcomes</b>
joint with Andreu Arenas and Jenifer Ruiz-Valenzuela
In this paper, we answer the question of how the costs facing students to <u>retake a course</u> affect their behavior and academic outcomes. To get a answer, We use administrative data from a large Spanish university and exploit a change in the tuition fees for students in Catalonia around 2010. This policy change raised the retake costs by 50% to 100%, depending on the times of repetition.
