##### <b>Punishing Failures at University</b>
<i>joint with <a href="">Andreu Arenas</a> and <a href="">Jenifer Ruiz-Valenzuela</a></i> <br>
In this paper, we answer the question of how the costs facing students to <u>retake a course</u> affect their behavior and academic outcomes. To get a answer, We use administrative data from a large public university in Spain and exploit an tuition fees increase after 2010 when the costs from retaking a failed module were greatly raised. We examine both the equity and efficiency sides of such a punishment on failures, by analyzing students' reactions such as persistence, number of credits enrolled, and academic performance. We find that, financially punishing failures can unproportionally push away marginal performers and part-time students. Male students also react more by dropping out. We do not see evidence of asymmetric effect between high and low SES students. In terms of efficiency, we find that under the threat of being punished, the number of attempts a student needs to pass a subject decrease, consequently reducing the number of credits they enroll in. However, conditional on passing, their grades do not increase, which means punishment incentivizes students to exert more effort to prevent failures, but not to increase their overall performance once they can pass.
