    <b>BESTEPS</b> is a training project I coordinated in academic years
    2024/25 and 2025/26, financed by the
    <a href="https://web.ub.edu/en/web/escola-doctorat/" target="_blank">EDUB</a>
    and supported by the
    <a href="https://www.ub.edu/school-economics/" target="_blank">UBSE</a>.
    Designed for early-stage economists, the programme is structured as a series
    of lectures covering key research phases — from identifying and adapting
    feasible projects, to effectively communicating findings and producing
    final academic products.
